# TODO List

This week, we're going to create a TODO list app. The first step is to set up the basic html for entering new items and displaying them

1. Create a text input for adding new items to the TODO list
2. When you hit the `enter` key, a new TODO item should appear on your TODO list, and the text input should be cleared. There are multiple ways to do this.
3. Each TODO item should have a checkbox and a corresponding label

Bonus:
1. Use CSS to make the text input bigger
